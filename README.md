# Node.js, Express, and MongoDB Project

Welcome to my Node.js, Express, and MongoDB project! This repository contains a full-stack application or backend API built using Node.js for the server-side, Express.js for handling routes, and MongoDB for database management. It serves as a great starting point for anyone looking to build scalable web applications with these technologies.
